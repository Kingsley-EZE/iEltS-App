    <string name="details"> Air pollution is increasingly becoming the focus of government and citizen concern around the
globe. From Mexico City and New York to Singapore and Tokyo, new solutions to this old problem
are being proposed, Mailed and implemented with ever increasing speed. It is feared that unless
pollution reduction measures are able to keep pace with the continued pressures of urban growth,
air quality in many of the world’s major cities will deteriorate beyond reason.
 Action is being taken along several fronts: through new legislation, improved enforcement and
innovative technology. In Los Angeles, state regulations are forcing manufacturers to try to
sell ever cleaner cars: their first of the cleanest, titled "Zero Emission Vehicles’, have
to be available soon, since they are intended to make up 2 percent of sales in 1997. Local
authorities in London are campaigning to be allowed to enforce anti-pollution laws themselves;
at present only the police have the power to do so, but they tend to be busy elsewhere.
In Singapore, renting out road space to users is the way of the future.
When Britain’s Royal Automobile Club monitored the exhausts of 60,000 vehicles, it found that 12
percent of them produced more than half the total pollution. Older cars were the worst offenders;
though a sizeable number of quite new cars were also identified as gross polluters, they were
simply badly tuned. California has developed a scheme to get these gross polluters off the streets:
they offer a flat $700 for any old, run-down vehicle driven in by its owner. The aim is to remove
the heaviest-polluting, most decrepit vehicles from the roads.</string>
